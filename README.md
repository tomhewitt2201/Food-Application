# Food-Application
Application that will allow us to randomly select meals for a week instead of having to creatively think of them. 

It's MVP would be a button that when pressed will use an RNG to select a number of products already kept within an array and spit them out into a list.

To avoid duplications, it's going to splice each list item after it has been used and store it in a seperate list (should I decide I need it later).
